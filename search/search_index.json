For complete guides to homebrew and custom firmware for other devices, check out Hacks.Guide . Important Thoroughly read all of the introductory pages (including this one!) before proceeding. This guide is for retail (consumer purchased; not from the Nintendo Developer Program) consoles only ! If you have a developer (\"PANDA\") console, check out the Panda 3DS Hacks Guide . This guide is available in other languages! Click the icon at the top right of the page to change the language. Alternatively, click here to help to keep these translations up to date. This guide needs your help to seed these torrents! What is Homebrew? Homebrew usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. This includes homebrew tools, applications, games, and emulators. In many cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using just the Nintendo 3DS Sound app. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running. What is Custom Firmware? Custom Firmware (\"CFW\") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu. CFW can be set up on any console on any version (but may require additional tools / accessories for versions >11.3.0). What does this guide install? This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified 3DS from stock firmware to boot9strap powered Custom Firmware. On some versions, it utilizes homebrew as a stepping off point, but Custom Firmware is still the goal. boot9strap is the newest and best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system only milliseconds into boot, which is similar to the effect of BootMii for the Wii. It gives us even earlier control than arm9loaderhax did, and, unlike standard sighax, boot9strap uses an NDMA overwrite exploit in order to gain Boot9 code execution. This means that any console running boot9strap is capable of dumping the console unique OTP ( OTP.bin ), the ARM11 bootrom ( boot11.bin ), and the ARM9 bootrom ( boot9.bin ). The benefits of boot9strap over other Custom Firmware launch methods are numerous, and as such it is recommended to use this guide over any other that relies on outdated software (such as menuhax + rxTools, arm9loaderhax, or even normal sighax). For information on how boot9strap works, please see this paper . For a list of each of the calculated sighax signatures, see this gist . What can I do with Custom Firmware? Play all game cards and eShop games, regardless of region Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens Use \"ROM hacks\" for games that you own Take gameplay and application screenshots Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators. (Works best with a New Nintendo 3DS) Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your HOME Menu Dump your game cards to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card New 3DS or New 2DS only: stream live gameplay to your PC wirelessly with NTR CFW Run many old Nintendo DS flash carts that were blocked long ago or never worked on Nintendo 3DS Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew What do I need to know before starting? Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of 3DS hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY. If you have already hacked your 3DS before to get an EmuNAND setup, and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, you should follow all instructions and restore your existing EmuNAND when prompted once you reach Finalizing Setup . This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS in all regions and all versions, including the latest version (11.14.0). If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved). Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off! Your SD card should be MBR, not GPT (the SD card that comes with your device will be MBR by default). The easiest way to test this is to check if the SD card works in your 3DS. If it works, the SD card is MBR. If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can format it to FAT32 using guiformat (Windows) , Disk Utility (Mac) , or cfdisk (Linux) . The Old 2DS is essentially identical to the Old 3DS in terms of software, while the New 2DS is essentially identical to the New 3DS in terms of software. Any steps which say \"Old 3DS\" also apply to Old 2DS, and any steps which say \"New 3DS\" also apply to New 2DS. In order to follow this guide, you will need to be able to put files onto the SD card.

The following instructions only work if you have a system that implements udev . Most modern distros come with systemd already installed, which includes a udev implementation. Do the following instructions while your Switch is not connected to your computer. Option 1: Manually adding rules and group The following instructions are not for beginners. Only do this if you understand what you are doing. Creating a new group To start, we will create a new group and add ourselves to it. The group the Nintendo Switch device will be owned by on Linux will be set to this group. Open a terminal. Enter the following command: sudo groupadd nintendo_switch . Enter your password when prompted. Enter the following command: sudo usermod -a -G nintendo_switch $USER . Make sure that the G is capitalized! Close the terminal. Adding a udev rule Next we're gonna add a new udev rule. udev is a device manager for the linux kernel. The rule we're gonna specify is that if the Switch is connected in RCM mode, the group the Switch belongs to will be the group we made in the previous section. Open a terminal. Change to the root user with the following command: sudo su . Enter your password when prompted. Enter the following command: mkdir -p /etc/udev/rules.d .

AutoRCM causes the console to believe it is bricked, and will automatically launch RCM upon boot for recovery purposes, without needing a jig. As RCM is a recovery mode from repair specialists, this is an intended feature from the device developer, though is also considered a softbrick. If you aren't careful, misuse of AutoRCM can lead to real damage , especially with units that cannot inject custom RCM payloads (like Mariko hardware). Please take care when using it. Please keep in mind that the console can no longer boot on its own, so you'll need a PC, phone, or other payload injector to start the console after a coldboot. Note: If the console screen stays black when pressing the power button after activating AutoRCM, remember that it's not broken. It's in RCM. If you don't have a BOOT0/1 backup yet... You really want to kill your console, huh? If you haven't made a BOOT0/1 backup yet, it is recommended to make one right now . Boot Hekate Go to Tools , and select Backup eMMC Then tap eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1 and let the process complete. Disadvantages of AutoRCM There are some disadvantages you should consider before installing AutoRCM: Please keep in mind that the console can no longer boot on its own, so you'll need a PC, phone, or other payload injector to start the console after letting the console fully shut off. (AutoRCM by itself is considered a \"tethered jailbreak\"). Note: Sleep Mode is not considered \"powering off/on\" the console. Sleep Mode will still work as intended and is fully unchanged with AutoRCM. When completely discharged, your Switch will take a very long time to charge while in RCM. To solve this, charge the console for approximately twenty minutes before booting into Hekate and selecting a boot option. After it's done booting, the console will now charge at a normal speed with a battery icon in the corner. Advantages of AutoRCM AutoRCM can be used for good as well: If you were having trouble getting into RCM before (i.e you were using the tinfoil method), now you can get into RCM without any hassle. If you want to keep fuses unburned, you can do so with AutoRCM, as the Switch never gets the chance to burn them. Nintendo's bootloaders burn the fuses, but those bootloaders cannot be used if AutoRCM is enabled. Note: updating the console while booted into Hekate's \"stock\" configuration will clear AutoRCM on the next reboot. Please update while using custom firmware, or be sure to use a jig after the console reboots. It's easier to inject a payload using a payload injector, as using your jig and booting into RCM manually is no longer required. Other information... This method corrupts a single byte in both your BOOT0 and your BOOT1 partitions. This is why a backup of those is recommended. This software version of AutoRCM can almost always be reversed, so don't freak out if it doesn't work out the way you'd like it to. If, despite all of the warnings above, you still wish to install AutoRCM, and understand the risks, do the following: Boot Hekate Go to Tools At the bottom of the page, tap Archive bit - AutoRCM Then tap AutoRCM .

Hacking terms The following list is in alphabetical order. 90DNS : DNS that blocks system updates on the Nintendo Switch. This can be enabled by following the guide here . Atmosphere : The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide. AutoRCM : A method that corrupts parts of your boot0 and boot1, causing the Switch to boot into RCM automatically. Using this requires an additional peripheral (such as a computer, phone, dongle or trinket) to be able to boot your Switch. boot0 and boot1 : Two partitions of the Switch NAND. CFW : Short for custom firmware. Custom firmware permits you to completely modify how your Switch works. Deja Vu : An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1. DNS : Domain Name System . Basically, it's the internet's addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS is what tells you what server the site is hosted on. Dongle : Device you can plug in the charging port of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM. Encryption keys : Keys used to encrypt files from the Nintendo Switch. These can be dumped by following the guide here . BIS keys : Specific keys used to decrypt the NAND. fusee-gelee / ShofEL2 : Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootrom access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1s RCM and permits us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device and a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while ShofEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee. hactool : Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files. Hekate : A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosphere to boot CFW. Homebrew : Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit. Homebrew launcher : Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew. Jig : Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joycon rail to enter RCM. KIP : Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality. NAND : The internal filesystem used by the Switch. Contains boot0 and boot1, as well as PRODINFO and various other partitions. nx-hbloader : Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere. PRODINFO : A partition on the NAND of your Switch. This along with boot0 and boot1 is the only part of your Switch that can render it unbootable if improperly modified. Atmosphere backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup. ReSwitched : A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosphere. RCM : A shorthand for \"Recovery Mode\". When talking about hacking the Switch, this commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the joycons. Ways of pressing this button can be found here . TegraRCMGUI / fusee-interface-tk : Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch. Tegra X1 : A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch. Trinket : A tiny chip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload if it is in RCM. TrustZone : The highest security level on the Switch. XCI/NSP : Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles. Resources The resources below are for users and developers interested in developing Homebrew or for those that want to get a more technical understanding of the various concepts. The ReSwitched FAQ lists a general overview of how the Switch works. Switchbrew is a wiki detailing the inner workings of the Nintendo Switch's firmware. libNX documentation .

After following our guide, your system will consist of three core elements that can be updated. Atmosphere, Hekate and your system firmware. Updating Atmosphere When updating Atmosphere always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. When a new version of Atmosphere releases, you can update Atmosphere by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest release of Atmosphere (Download the atmosphere-(version)-master-(version)+hbl-(version)+hbmenu-(version).zip release of Atmosphere. Do not download the atmosphere-EXPERIMENTAL-(version)-master-(version)+hbl-(version)+hbmenu-(version).zip release.) Copy the contents of the Atmosphere .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are prompted to overwrite files, do so. (If your hekate is not on the latest version) Update hekate via the steps below Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch CFW. Updating Hekate When updating Hekate always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. When a new version of Hekate releases, you can update by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest version of Hekate (Download the hekate_ctcaer_(version).zip release of hekate). Copy the bootloader folder from the Hekate .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are asked to overwrite or merge files while copying, say yes to merge/overwrite them. Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch Hekate. Go to the Options tab at the top right of the screen. Turn \"Update Reboot 2 Payload\" on the bottom right ON (if it isn't on already). Tap \"Save Options\" at the bottom of the screen. Updating your firmware Always check before updating your system firmware if the latest version of Atmosphere as well as the latest version of Hekate support the firmware version you are updating towards. Currently the latest version supported by Atmosphere and Hekate is: 12.0.2 . In addition, updating to or past some firmwares update the gamecard firmware. Reference the table below for information about these. Updating from Updating towards Updates gamecard firmware Below 4.0.0 Below 4.0.0 No Below 4.0.0 4.0.0 or above Yes On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 At least 4.1.0 but below 9.0.0 No On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 9.0.0 or above Yes On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 At least 9.1.0 but below 11.0.0 No On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 11.0.0 or above Yes On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 At least 11.0.1 but below 12.0.0 No On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 12.0.0 or above Yes On or above 12.0.0 Latest supported Atmosphere & Hekate revision No If at least one of the versions you are updating towards also updates the gamecard firmware, you will not be able to downgrade below that version without making the gamecard slot unusable until you update. Atmosphere (and Hekate) come bundled with patches that automatically disable the gamecard slot if it is detected that the system has an older gamecard firmware that would be updated. If you boot into RCM on each boot (for example by using AutoRCM), this means that the gamecard slot will not be updated and you can downgrade below that version. If this happens, you will not be able to use the gamecard slot as long as you are on the newer firmware. Otherwise, you can safely update your system firmware through the system settings. Note about autoRCM If you have autoRCM enabled and you're updating your system while in stock firmware, updating will disable autoRCM and you will need to enter RCM manually to boot custom firmware again. To prevent autoRCM from being disabled, boot CFW on sysMMC and update through settings from there, as booting without AutoRCM will burn any preserved fuses . About emuMMC sysMMC and emuMMC have separate system firmwares and need to be updated separately. If you keep your emuMMC offline, you will have to use a gamecard to update your system firmware, synchronize it with another Nintendo Switch or dump an updated firmware from your sysMMC. Updating emuMMC by dumping an updated firmware from your sysMMC Do you have an eMMC backup yet? Please do not start this guide without doing a RAW GPP and a BOOT 0/1 eMMC backup! You can learn how to make one here . Downgrading This guide is made for updating your emuMMC. It is not for downgrading. Downgrading at all, sysMMC or emuMMC, is not recommended and not worth it. Downgrading is also very dangerous and can lead to serious complications even when performed correctly. What you will need The latest release of TegraExplorer The latest release of Atmosphere Preparing your SD card Insert your microSD card into your computer. Download TegraExplorer.bin and place it somewhere on your PC (A good idea is to put it where you keep all your switch payloads like Hekate). Update Atmosphere and Hekate by using the above guides. If you haven't already, update the sysMMC to the latest firmware. Dumping your sysMMC firmware Make sure your sysMMC is up to date. If your sysMMC is not up-to-date, update it through the System Settings. Inject TegraExplorer.bin using TegraRCMGUI (Like you would with Hekate). Using the joystick and the A buttons, select Dump Firmware . Wait about 1-2 minutes for the tool to dump your firmware. When the tool finishes, press any button. Select Reboot to atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin . Updating your emuMMC with Daybreak In Hekate go to Launch -> Atmosphere FSS0 Emu . Once booted, hold R while launching a game to boot into the homebrew menu. Find Daybreak in the homebrew menu and launch it. Tap on Install and navigate to tegraexplorer/Firmware/<latest firmware number> . Tap on Continue and then Preserve settings . If you see the message Warning: exFAT firmware is missing or corrupt , you likely don't have the exFAT drivers installed on your sysMMC. Just press continue if this is the case.

Fortunately, due to the fusee-gelee vulnerability, this special mode acts as our gateway into CFW. There are several methods of entering RCM ( R e C overy M ode). The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems. Also note that RCM is a different recovery mode than the one accessed by holding Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power. Note The order of methods on this page is in the order of ease. The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins on the right joycon rail. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Please note that once you have successfully entered RCM, you can take the jig out of the joycon rail. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 9 & 10 Click to expand!

Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console.

All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw.

Fortunately, due to the fusee-gelee vulnerability, this special mode acts as our gateway into CFW. There are several methods of entering RCM ( R e C overy M ode). The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems. Also note that RCM is a different recovery mode than the one accessed by holding Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power. Note The order of methods on this page is in the order of ease. The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins on the right joycon rail. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Please note that once you have successfully entered RCM, you can take the jig out of the joycon rail. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 9 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method will result in the right Joy-Con being detected as in wireless mode while attached to the Switch, and this method may result in the Joy-Con being permanently detected as wireless if you update the Joy-Con firmware while this mod is installed. In the latter case, fixing this requires opening up the Joy-Con and reseating the battery. It is recommended to solder pads 7 and 10 together with a resistor instead. Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pads 9 and 10 (seen below) together. This can either be done using a small wire, or directly bridging the pads with solder. Here is an example from YyAoMmIi#3705 on our Discord server. Bent Joy-Con Pins (Not recommended) Click to expand!

In the latter case, fixing this requires opening up the Joy-Con and reseating the battery. Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily, and use a thin object such as a knife to gently bend pin 9 and 10 (shown below) slightly up and towards each other so they touch, shorting them.

Launching the Homebrew Menu You will now be able to launch the Homebrew Menu by opening the album or by holding the R button while launching any game (including demos/cartridges), or application (e.g. Youtube/Hulu). If R is not held, the game or application will launch like normal. A note about using the album for the Homebrew Menu Using the album for the Homebrew Menu instead of a game or application has several limitations, including but not limited to: a smaller amount of available memory (RAM), as well as being unable to launch a full-featured web browser. It is strongly recommended to launch homebrew through applications or games instead. Adding new applications Place homebrew applications ( .nro files) into the switch folder on your SD card. What the included homebrew applications do Checkpoint is a save manager, it can dump and restore saves from/to your system. For more information, see Save Management FTPD is a ftp tool for connecting your Switch's sd card wirelessly to your pc. Tools like Filezilla can connect to your switch on (ip of switch):5000 NX-Shell is a file explorer for the Switch.

Do not skip these steps. Making a NAND Backup Important A NAND backup is crucial. They can be used to restore the device to a working state in case of emergencies. Once the backup is finished, keep it somewhere safe. The best backup is the one you have but never need, and the worst backup is the one you need but never made. To save space, it's recommended to compress the end-result with a .zip file or something similar. It's highly recommended that you use an SD card that is formatted to FAT32 and has at least 32 gigabytes of space free. This will still work on smaller cards, but it's not ideal. Instructions Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload Use the touch screen to navigate to Tools and then Backup eMMC Tap on eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1 This should only take a few seconds, but if your SD card is very slow, it may take around a minute. Tap on Close to continue, then tap on eMMC RAW GPP This will take a long time. Expect it to take between 10 minutes to an hour (or more, if your SD card is very slow). On FAT32 SD cards or cards that have less than 32 gigabytes of space available, the NAND will be split into 1 or 2 gigabyte parts. Hekate will stop producing these parts when it runs out of space. When this happens, do the following: Power off your system Insert your SD card into your PC Move all files from the backup folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC Insert your SD card into your Switch Enter RCM again, inject Hekate again, and continue the backup by tapping on Tools > Backup eMMC > eMMC RAW GPP Repeat the process until the NAND is completely dumped Press Close > Home > Power Off Insert your SD card into your PC Copy the backup folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC Getting your Console's Unique Keys Important These keys are critical to have. In an extreme emergency, they can be used in conjunction with your NAND backup and other tools to restore your console to a working state. Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload. Tap the Payloads option, then press Lockpick_RCM.bin. If Lockpick_RCM asks you to select between SysNAND and emuMMC, choose SysNAND by navigating with the volume buttons and pressing the power button. If not, continue with step 4. If Lockpick_RCM prompts you to Reboot to Sept , press power or either volume button to do so. A \"sept by Atmosphere\" logo will then display, followed by Lockpick_RCM starting again. If it does not prompt you, continue on to step 5. Lockpick_RCM should now inform you that your keys have been saved to /switch/prod.keys on the SD card. Press any button to return to the main menu. Navigate to 'Power off' with the volume buttons and select it with the power button. Insert your SD card into your PC. Copy prod.keys from the switch folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC (it is suggested to copy it to the same place that you copied your NAND backup to).
