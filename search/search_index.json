For complete guides to homebrew and custom firmware for other devices, check out Hacks.Guide . Important Thoroughly read all of the introductory pages (including this one!) before proceeding. This guide is for retail (consumer purchased; not from the Nintendo Developer Program) consoles only ! If you have a developer (\"PANDA\") console, check out the Panda 3DS Hacks Guide . This guide is available in other languages! Click the icon at the top right of the page to change the language. Alternatively, click here to help to keep these translations up to date. This guide needs your help to seed these torrents! What is Homebrew? Homebrew usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. This includes homebrew tools, applications, games, and emulators. In many cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using just the Nintendo 3DS Sound app. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running. What is Custom Firmware? Custom Firmware (\"CFW\") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu. CFW can be set up on any console on any version (but may require additional tools / accessories for versions >11.3.0). What does this guide install? This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified 3DS from stock firmware to boot9strap powered Custom Firmware. On some versions, it utilizes homebrew as a stepping off point, but Custom Firmware is still the goal. boot9strap is the newest and best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system only milliseconds into boot, which is similar to the effect of BootMii for the Wii. It gives us even earlier control than arm9loaderhax did, and, unlike standard sighax, boot9strap uses an NDMA overwrite exploit in order to gain Boot9 code execution. This means that any console running boot9strap is capable of dumping the console unique OTP ( OTP.bin ), the ARM11 bootrom ( boot11.bin ), and the ARM9 bootrom ( boot9.bin ). The benefits of boot9strap over other Custom Firmware launch methods are numerous, and as such it is recommended to use this guide over any other that relies on outdated software (such as menuhax + rxTools, arm9loaderhax, or even normal sighax). For information on how boot9strap works, please see this paper . For a list of each of the calculated sighax signatures, see this gist . What can I do with Custom Firmware? Play all game cards and eShop games, regardless of region Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens Use \"ROM hacks\" for games that you own Take gameplay and application screenshots Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators. (Works best with a New Nintendo 3DS) Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your HOME Menu Dump your game cards to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card New 3DS or New 2DS only: stream live gameplay to your PC wirelessly with NTR CFW Run many old Nintendo DS flash carts that were blocked long ago or never worked on Nintendo 3DS Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew What do I need to know before starting? Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of 3DS hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY. If you have already hacked your 3DS before to get an EmuNAND setup, and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, you should follow all instructions and restore your existing EmuNAND when prompted once you reach Finalizing Setup . This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS in all regions and all versions, including the latest version (11.14.0). If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved). Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off! Your SD card should be MBR, not GPT (the SD card that comes with your device will be MBR by default). The easiest way to test this is to check if the SD card works in your 3DS. If it works, the SD card is MBR. If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can format it to FAT32 using guiformat (Windows) , Disk Utility (Mac) , or cfdisk (Linux) . The Old 2DS is essentially identical to the Old 3DS in terms of software, while the New 2DS is essentially identical to the New 3DS in terms of software. Any steps which say \"Old 3DS\" also apply to Old 2DS, and any steps which say \"New 3DS\" also apply to New 2DS. In order to follow this guide, you will need to be able to put files onto the SD card.

Do the following instructions while your Switch is not connected to your computer. Option 1: Manually adding rules and group The following instructions are not for beginners. Only do this if you understand what you are doing. Creating a new group To start, we will create a new group and add ourselves to it. The group the Nintendo Switch device will be owned by on Linux will be set to this group. Open a terminal. Enter the following command: sudo groupadd nintendo_switch . Enter your password when prompted. Enter the following command: sudo usermod -a -G nintendo_switch $USER . Make sure that the G is capitalized! Close the terminal. Adding a udev rule Next we're gonna add a new udev rule. udev is a device manager for the linux kernel. The rule we're gonna specify is that if the Switch is connected in RCM mode, the group the Switch belongs to will be the group we made in the previous section. Open a terminal.

AutoRCM causes the console to believe it is bricked, and will automatically launch RCM upon boot for recovery purposes, without needing a jig. As RCM is a recovery mode from repair specialists, this is an intended feature from the device developer, though is also considered a softbrick. If you aren't careful, misuse of AutoRCM can lead to real damage , especially with units that cannot inject custom RCM payloads (like Mariko hardware). Please take care when using it. Please keep in mind that the console can no longer boot on its own, so you'll need a PC, phone, or other payload injector to start the console after a coldboot. Note: If the console screen stays black when pressing the power button after activating AutoRCM, remember that it's not broken. It's in RCM. If you don't have a BOOT0/1 backup yet... You really want to kill your console, huh? If you haven't made a BOOT0/1 backup yet, it is recommended to make one right now . Boot Hekate Go to Tools , and select Backup eMMC Then tap eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1 and let the process complete. Disadvantages of AutoRCM There are some disadvantages you should consider before installing AutoRCM: Please keep in mind that the console can no longer boot on its own, so you'll need a PC, phone, or other payload injector to start the console after letting the console fully shut off. (AutoRCM by itself is considered a \"tethered jailbreak\"). Note: Sleep Mode is not considered \"powering off/on\" the console. Sleep Mode will still work as intended and is fully unchanged with AutoRCM. When completely discharged, your Switch will take a very long time to charge while in RCM. To solve this, charge the console for approximately twenty minutes before booting into Hekate and selecting a boot option. After it's done booting, the console will now charge at a normal speed with a battery icon in the corner. Advantages of AutoRCM AutoRCM can be used for good as well: If you were having trouble getting into RCM before (i.e you were using the tinfoil method), now you can get into RCM without any hassle. If you want to keep fuses unburned, you can do so with AutoRCM, as the Switch never gets the chance to burn them. Nintendo's bootloaders burn the fuses, but those bootloaders cannot be used if AutoRCM is enabled. Note: updating the console while booted into Hekate's \"stock\" configuration will clear AutoRCM on the next reboot. Please update while using custom firmware, or be sure to use a jig after the console reboots. It's easier to inject a payload using a payload injector, as using your jig and booting into RCM manually is no longer required. Other information... This method corrupts a single byte in both your BOOT0 and your BOOT1 partitions. This is why a backup of those is recommended. This software version of AutoRCM can almost always be reversed, so don't freak out if it doesn't work out the way you'd like it to. If, despite all of the warnings above, you still wish to install AutoRCM, and understand the risks, do the following: Boot Hekate Go to Tools At the bottom of the page, tap Archive bit - AutoRCM Then tap AutoRCM .

Hacking terms The following list is in alphabetical order. 90DNS : DNS that blocks system updates on the Nintendo Switch. This can be enabled by following the guide here . Atmosphere : The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide. AutoRCM : A method that corrupts parts of your boot0 and boot1, causing the Switch to boot into RCM automatically. Using this requires an additional peripheral (such as a computer, phone, dongle or trinket) to be able to boot your Switch. boot0 and boot1 : Two partitions of the Switch NAND. CFW : Short for custom firmware. Custom firmware permits you to completely modify how your Switch works. Deja Vu : An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1. DNS : Domain Name System . Basically, it's the internet's addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS is what tells you what server the site is hosted on. Dongle : Device you can plug in the charging port of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM. Encryption keys : Keys used to encrypt files from the Nintendo Switch. These can be dumped by following the guide here . BIS keys : Specific keys used to decrypt the NAND. fusee-gelee / ShofEL2 : Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootrom access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1s RCM and permits us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device and a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while ShofEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee. hactool : Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files. Hekate : A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosphere to boot CFW. Homebrew : Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit. Homebrew launcher : Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew. Jig : Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joycon rail to enter RCM. KIP : Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality. NAND : The internal filesystem used by the Switch. Contains boot0 and boot1, as well as PRODINFO and various other partitions. nx-hbloader : Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere. PRODINFO : A partition on the NAND of your Switch. This along with boot0 and boot1 is the only part of your Switch that can render it unbootable if improperly modified. Atmosphere backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup. ReSwitched : A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosphere. RCM : A shorthand for \"Recovery Mode\". When talking about hacking the Switch, this commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the joycons. Ways of pressing this button can be found here . TegraRCMGUI / fusee-interface-tk : Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch. Tegra X1 : A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch. Trinket : A tiny chip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload if it is in RCM. TrustZone : The highest security level on the Switch. XCI/NSP : Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles. Resources The resources below are for users and developers interested in developing Homebrew or for those that want to get a more technical understanding of the various concepts. The ReSwitched FAQ lists a general overview of how the Switch works. Switchbrew is a wiki detailing the inner workings of the Nintendo Switch's firmware. libNX documentation .

After following our guide, your system will consist of three core elements that can be updated. Atmosphere, Hekate and your system firmware. Updating Atmosphere When updating Atmosphere always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. When a new version of Atmosphere releases, you can update Atmosphere by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest release of Atmosphere (Download the atmosphere-(version)-master-(version)+hbl-(version)+hbmenu-(version).zip release of Atmosphere. Do not download the atmosphere-EXPERIMENTAL-(version)-master-(version)+hbl-(version)+hbmenu-(version).zip release.) Copy the contents of the Atmosphere .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are prompted to overwrite files, do so. (If your hekate is not on the latest version) Update hekate via the steps below Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch CFW. Updating Hekate When updating Hekate always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. When a new version of Hekate releases, you can update by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest version of Hekate (Download the hekate_ctcaer_(version).zip release of hekate). Copy the bootloader folder from the Hekate .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are asked to overwrite or merge files while copying, say yes to merge/overwrite them. Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch Hekate. Go to the Options tab at the top right of the screen. Turn \"Update Reboot 2 Payload\" on the bottom right ON (if it isn't on already). Tap \"Save Options\" at the bottom of the screen. Updating your firmware Always check before updating your system firmware if the latest version of Atmosphere as well as the latest version of Hekate support the firmware version you are updating towards. Currently the latest version supported by Atmosphere and Hekate is: 12.0.2 . In addition, updating to or past some firmwares update the gamecard firmware. Reference the table below for information about these. Updating from Updating towards Updates gamecard firmware Below 4.0.0 Below 4.0.0 No Below 4.0.0 4.0.0 or above Yes On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 At least 4.1.0 but below 9.0.0 No On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 9.0.0 or above Yes On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 At least 9.1.0 but below 11.0.0 No On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 11.0.0 or above Yes On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 At least 11.0.1 but below 12.0.0 No On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 12.0.0 or above Yes On or above 12.0.0 Latest supported Atmosphere & Hekate revision No If at least one of the versions you are updating towards also updates the gamecard firmware, you will not be able to downgrade below that version without making the gamecard slot unusable until you update. Atmosphere (and Hekate) come bundled with patches that automatically disable the gamecard slot if it is detected that the system has an older gamecard firmware that would be updated. If you boot into RCM on each boot (for example by using AutoRCM), this means that the gamecard slot will not be updated and you can downgrade below that version. If this happens, you will not be able to use the gamecard slot as long as you are on the newer firmware. Otherwise, you can safely update your system firmware through the system settings. Note about autoRCM If you have autoRCM enabled and you're updating your system while in stock firmware, updating will disable autoRCM and you will need to enter RCM manually to boot custom firmware again. To prevent autoRCM from being disabled, boot CFW on sysMMC and update through settings from there, as booting without AutoRCM will burn any preserved fuses . About emuMMC sysMMC and emuMMC have separate system firmwares and need to be updated separately. If you keep your emuMMC offline, you will have to use a gamecard to update your system firmware, synchronize it with another Nintendo Switch or dump an updated firmware from your sysMMC. Updating emuMMC by dumping an updated firmware from your sysMMC Do you have an eMMC backup yet? Please do not start this guide without doing a RAW GPP and a BOOT 0/1 eMMC backup! You can learn how to make one here . Downgrading This guide is made for updating your emuMMC. It is not for downgrading. Downgrading at all, sysMMC or emuMMC, is not recommended and not worth it. Downgrading is also very dangerous and can lead to serious complications even when performed correctly. What you will need The latest release of TegraExplorer The latest release of Atmosphere Preparing your SD card Insert your microSD card into your computer. Download TegraExplorer.bin and place it somewhere on your PC (A good idea is to put it where you keep all your switch payloads like Hekate). Update Atmosphere and Hekate by using the above guides. If you haven't already, update the sysMMC to the latest firmware. Dumping your sysMMC firmware Make sure your sysMMC is up to date. If your sysMMC is not up-to-date, update it through the System Settings. Inject TegraExplorer.bin using TegraRCMGUI (Like you would with Hekate). Using the joystick and the A buttons, select Dump Firmware . Wait about 1-2 minutes for the tool to dump your firmware. When the tool finishes, press any button. Select Reboot to atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin . Updating your emuMMC with Daybreak In Hekate go to Launch -> Atmosphere FSS0 Emu .

Some flashcarts may require firmware or \"kernel\" files to be copied to the flashcart SD card. Consult your specific flashcart's instructions for more information. Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information. The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons. To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot. {: .notice--info} Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional on NDS and custom firmware 3DS systems only ). This means that, for most flashcarts, it will not even display on the home menu. There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done. Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to brick a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as NDS Card ) {: .notice--danger} Methods Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System) This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.

Some flashcarts may require firmware or \"kernel\" files to be copied to the flashcart SD card. Consult your specific flashcart's instructions for more information. Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information. The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons. To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot. {: .notice--info} Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional on NDS and custom firmware 3DS systems only ). This means that, for most flashcarts, it will not even display on the home menu. There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done. Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to brick a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as NDS Card ) {: .notice--danger}","title":"Required Reading"},{"location":"user-guide/ntrboot/ntrboot.html#methods","text":"","title":"Methods"},{"location":"user-guide/ntrboot/ntrboot.html#flashing-ntrboot-3ds-single-system","text":"This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.
